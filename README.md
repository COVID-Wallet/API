# COVID Wallet (API)

API for [COVID Wallet](https://covidwallet.pt)

This API, written in Swift and using Vapor as its web framework, takes care of converting a QR code from the Portuguese EU COVID Digital Certificate into a pass that can be imported into the Wallet on iOS devices.

Even though it's written in Swift, it can be run on at least macOS and Linux.
